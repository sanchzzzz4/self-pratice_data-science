Program to take cordinates of two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) and calculate distance between them.

import math

# Take input for coordinates of the two points
x1 = float(input("Enter x1: "))
y1 = float(input("Enter y1: "))
x2 = float(input("Enter x2: "))
y2 = float(input("Enter y2: "))

# Calculate the distance
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)

# Print the distance
print("The distance between the two points is:", distance)
