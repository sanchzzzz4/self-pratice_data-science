Program to take height and base of a right-angled triangle from the user and calculate its hypotenuse:

import math
# Take input for height and base of the triangle
height = float(input("Enter the height of the triangle: "))
base = float(input("Enter the base of the triangle: "))

# Calculate the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem
hypotenuse = math.sqrt(height**2 + base**2)

# Print the hypotenuse
print("The hypotenuse of the triangle is:", hypotenuse)
